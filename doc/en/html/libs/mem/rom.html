<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>The ROM component stores up to 16,777,216 values (specified in the Address
Bit Width attribute), each of which can include up to to 32 bits
(specified in the Data Bit Width attribute). It behaves similarly to a
<a href="ram.html"><img class="icon" src="../../../icons/ram.gif"> RAM</a> with
the 'Non-Volatile' attribute set, but with a greatly simplified interface: a
circuit can access the current values in ROM, but it cannot change them, so
there is no clock, no control inputs, and there is only one output-only data
bus. The user can modify individual values interactively via the Poke Tool, or
the user can edit, export, or import the contents via the Menu Tool.</p>

<p>The ROM component's contents are stored as an attribute of the component.
This allows the ROM contents to be set before placing the component into the
circuit. Multiple ROM components can be kept in the toolbar, each configured
with different contents. The contents are non-volatile, and persist across
simulation resets or when Logisim exits.</p>

<p>Current values are displayed in the component. Addresses are displayed in hex
to the left of the display area. Inside the display area, each value is listed
in hex. The value at the currently selected address will be displayed in inverse
text (white on dark gray).</p>

<h2>Single, Dual, and Quad Lines Modes</h2>

<p>Logisim ROM has a 'Line Size' attribute that controls how many locations
("lines") of memory are accessed at a time. Setting 'Line Size' to 'Single' is
the simplest case: at most one location is accessed at a time, and there is one
output labeled <var>D</var>. When 'Line Size' is set to 'Dual', however, the ROM
component reads two locations simultaneously, and there are two outputs, labeled
<var>D</var> and <var>1</var>. In 'Quad' mode, ROM will read four locations,
with four databuses labeled <var>D</var>, <var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, and
<var>3</var>. The addresses accessed are all consective: for 'Dual' line mode,
ROM will access addresses <var>A</var> and <var>A+1</var>; for 'Quad' line mode,
ROM will access addresses <var>A</var>, <var>A+1</var>,  <var>A+2</var>, and
<var>A+3</var>.</p> 

<h2>Address Alignment</h2>

<p>In 'Dual' and 'Quad' line modes, the selected address must be aligned to a
multiple of 2 or 4, respectively. There is no support for mis-aligned accesses.
This means the lowest bit or lowest two bits of the address must always be zero
in those modes. If the address is mis-aligned the ROM will output all error (E)
values instead of loading data from the ROM contents.

<p>The decision to omit support in Logisim for mis-aligned addresses is
deliberate. Support for mis-aligned addresses is not trivial in many actual
scenarios: a memory chip may require multiple row accesses, for example, in
order to perform a mis-aligned read. In addition, FPGA synthesis is
substantially simpler when mis-aligned addresses are not permitted.</p>

<h2>Importing and Exporting Memory Contents</h2>

The contents of memory can be imported from an external data file, or exported
to an external file. A variety of file formats are supported: see <a
href="../../guide/mem/importexport.html">Memory Import/Export Format</a> in the
<em>User's Guide</em> for details.</p>

<h2>Pins (assuming "Classic Logisim" appearance)</h2>

<dl>

<dt><var>A</var> on west edge (input, bit width matches Address Bit Width attribute)</dt>
<dd>Selects which of the values is currently being accessed by the circuit.</dd>

<dt><var>D</var> on east edge (input/output, bit width matches Data Bit Width attribute)</dt>
<dd>Outputs the value at the currently selected address.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>When the component is selected or being added,
the digits '0' through '9' alter its <q>Address Bit Width</q> attribute
and Alt-0 through Alt-9 alter its <q>Data Bit Width</q> attribute.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Address Bit Width</dt>
<dd>The bit width of the address bits. The number of values stored in
ROM is 2<sup><var>addrBitWidth</var></sup>.</dd>

<dt>Data Bit Width</dt>
<dd>The bit width of each individual value in memory.</dd>

<dt>Line Size</dt>
<dd>Allows for Single, Dual, or Quad line mode.</dd>

<dt>Contents</dt>
<dd>Stores the contents of memory.</dd>

<dt>Label</dt>
<dd>The text within the label associated with the register.</dd>

<dt>Label Font</dt>
<dd>The font with which to render the label.</dd>

<dt>Appearance</dt>
<dd>Selects between the "Classic Logisim" appearance style, which is somewhat
more compact, or "ANSI" style, which is more conventional but larger.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Poke Tool Behavior</h2>

<p>Clicking the ROM component brings keyboard and mouse focus to the ROM
(indicated by a red rectangle), allowing for the contents to be viewed or
edited. Because Poke Tool editing all takes place within a very small space, the
interface for this is severely but necessarily constrained. <!-- (see <a
href="../../guide/mem/poke.html">poking memory</a> in the <em>User's Guide</em>
for additional details about using the Poke Tool with memory).--> For all but the
simplest editing, it is more convenient to right-click the ROM and select "Edit
Contents..." to bring up the <a href="../../guide/mem/hex.html">integrated hex
editor</a>.</p>

<p>The Poke Tool has two modes of operation: You can edit the address displayed,
and you can edit an individual value at some memory location.</p>

<p><b>Editing Addresses:</b> Use the Poke Tool and click anywhere within the
memory component but <em>outside</em> the gray box holding the memory contents.
Logisim will draw a red rectangle around the address at the upper left corner.
From here:
<ul>
    <li><p>Typing <span class="key">R</span> or <span class="key">r</span> will
    clear the contents of memory.</li>
    <li><p>Typing hex digits will change the address (assuming the new address
    isn't too large) and scroll the memory contents to show that address.</li>
    <li><p>Scrolling with the mouse wheel increments or decrements the address
    and scrolls the memory forward or backward.
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Down</span> (or <span class="key">Enter</span>)
    key will increment the address and scroll the memory contents forward by one
    row.</li>
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Up</span> (or <span class="key">Backspace</span>
    or <span class="key">Delete</span>) keys will also increment or decrement
    the address to key will decrement the address and scroll the memory contents
    backwards by one row.</li>
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Page Down</span> (or <span
        class="key">Space</span>) and <span class="key">Page Up</span> keys will
    increment or decrement the address to scroll the memory contents forward or
    backward by one full page.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Editing Contents:</b> Use the Poke Tool and click anywhere within the
memory component <em>within</em> the gray box holding the memory contents.
Logisim will draw a red rectangle around the memory cell currently being
edited. From here:
<ul>
    <li><p>Typing <span class="key">R</span> or <span class="key">r</span> will
    clear the contents of memory.</li>
    <li><p>Typing hex digits will change the contents of that cell.</li>
    <li><p>Scrolling with the mouse wheel moves up or down to an adjacent memory
    cell.</li>
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Up</span>, <span class="key">Down</span>, <span
        class="key">Left</span>, and <span class="key">Right</span> arrow keys
    move to an adjacent memory cell.
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Page Up</span> and <span class="key">Page
        Down</span> keys move up or down by a full page.
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Backspace</span> (or <span
        class="key">Delete</span>) and <span class="key">Tab</span> (or <span
        class="key">Space</span>) keys similarly move to the previous or next
    memory cell.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FPGA Synthesis</h2><p>Supports VHDL and Verilog synthesis. With Verilog,
only 'Single' line mode is supported.
