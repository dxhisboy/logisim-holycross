<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>Displays arbitrary lines of text from a file, with one line hilighted
depending on the value of the inputs. When the input is <var>n</var>, the File
Viewer will scroll to, and highlight, line <var>n</var> of the file.
Alternatively, the text file can contain address labels (a number in decimal or
hex at the start of each line, followed by a ":"), and the File Viewer will
scroll to, and highlight, whichever line has address <var>n</var>.

<p>This component is particularly useful for building and simulating CPUs in
Logisim. By placing a File Viewer component into the circuit and loading the
text of the assembly-language program being executed elsewhere in the simulator,
and sending the program counter to the File Viewer where it is used to select
the line number of the file to hilight, the user can follow the program's
progress line by line. Similarly, if we send the current opcode from a circuit
to a File Viewer that is configured with a list of all opcode mnemonics, the
File Viewer will highlight the current opcode's mnemonic, which can be nice for
debugging purposes.

<h2>Pins</h2>

<p>There is only one input pin, on the west edge, with bit width matching the
value of the 'Address Bit Width' attribute. This input is used to select the
current line to highlight.

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Address Bit Width</dt>
<dd>The number of bits for the input pin.</dd>

<dt>Lines</dt>
<dd>The number of lines of the file to display at once, i.e. the "height" of the
display area for the component.</dd>

<dt>Columns</dt>
<dd>The number of characters wide the display area sholud be.</dd>

<dt>Select</dt>
<dd>If 'Select' is 'Line Number', an input value of <var>n</var> will cause line
<var>n</var> to be highlited. If 'Select' is 'Address Label', each line of the
file should be prefixed with an address (in hex or decimal) and a colon, and an
input value of <var>n</var> will cause the line with address label <var>n</var>
to be highlited.</dd>

<dt>Contents</dt>
<dd>The contents of the file to be displayed.</dd>
