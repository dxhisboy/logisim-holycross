<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>A pin serves as an output from a circuit or as an input to a circuit, depending on the value
of its 'Type' attribute. Logisim represents output
pins using a circle or rounded rectangle, and input pins are represented
using squares or rectangles. In either case, the individual bits of the
value being sent or received is displayed within the component (except
in printer view, when the bit width is shown instead).</p>

<p>A pin is a convenient component for interacting with a circuit, and
beginning Logisim users need not use them in any other way. But a
user building a circuit using several subcircuits (as described in the
`<a href="../../guide/subcirc/index.html">Subcircuits</a>' section of
the <em>User's Guide</em>) will use pins also
to specify the interface between an outer
circuit and the subcircuits it contains. In particular, a circuit layout's pin
components define the pins that appear on the subcircuit component when
the layout is used within another circuit. In such a circuit, the values
sent and received to those locations on the subcircuit component are
tied to the pins within the subcircuit layout.</p>

<h2>Pins</h2>

<p>A pin component has only one pin. Counterintuitively, when the Pin
component's type is set to 'input', the pin will actually be an output&mdash;
the Pin component in this case is taking input from the user (or from some other
circuit in which this layout is embedded) and outputting that value to the
connected wire. Conversely, when the Pin's type is set to 'output' the pin takes
input from the connected wire and outputs it to the screen for the user to see
(or to some other circuit in which thhis layout is embedded). In either case,
its bit width matches the Data Bits attribute, and its location depends on the
Facing attribute.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>When the component is selected or being added,
Alt-0 through Alt-9 alter its <q>Data Bits</q> attribute,
the arrow keys alter its <q>Facing</q> attribute,
and Alt with an arrow key alters its <q>Label Location</q> attribute.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Facing</dt>
<dd>The side of the component where its input/output pin should be.</dd>

<dt>Type</dt>
<dd>Specifies whether the component is used to input values into the circuit, or
to output values from the circuit.</dd>

<dt>Data Bits</dt>
<dd>The number of bits for the value that the pin handles.</dd>

<dt>Behavior</dt>
<dd>Controls how an input pin behaves in several special cases, mostly involving
error and unknown values. Output pins do not have a Behavior attribute, as they
work the same in all circumstances: whatever value is carried by the connected
wire is shown to the user and passed up to any parent circuit, and if no wire is
connected, an 'X' is used instead to indicate a floating value. For input pins,
several behaviors are available:
<ul><li><b>Simple</b>. In most cases "Simple" behavior should be sufficient. 
    For an input controled by the user, the user can select either zero or one
    (or any combination of zeros and ones for a multi-bit input pin). For an
    input controlled by a parent circuit, whatever value the parent sends (0, 1,
    E, or X, or some combination of them) is passed to the circuit, or zero is
    used if the parent does not have a wire connected to that pin. Note that
    with "Simple" behavior, an input pin will never create a new floating value
    (X) or error value (E), though it can passes them along from a parent
    circuit.</li>
    <li><b>Tri-State</b>. This behavior is nearly identical to "Simple"
    behavior, except that for input pins controlled by the user, the user can
    additional select "X" to indicate a floating input.</li>
    <li><b>Pull Down</b> and <b>Pull Up</b>. This behavior is nearly identical
    to "Simple" behavior, except that for input pins controlled by a parent
    circuit: if the parent circuit attempts to send an unknown value (X) to this
    pin, it will be converted automatically to either zero (for Pull Down) or one (for Pull
    Up) before being sent into the circuit. Note that this does not affect the
    parent circuit in any way&mdash;the parent circuit wire will still show X,
    while the subcircuit will receive a zero or one.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Label</dt>
<dd>The text within the label associated with the component.</dd>

<dt>Label Location</dt>
<dd>The location of the label relative to the component.</dd>

<dt>Label Font</dt>
<dd>The font with which to render the label.</dd>

<dt>Radix</dt>
<dd>The number base used for displaying values (and entering values for input
pins).</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Poke Tool Behavior</h2>

<p>Clicking an output pin has no effect, although the pin's attributes
will be displayed.</p>

<p>Clicking an input pin will toggle the bit that is clicked or, when the
'Radix' is set to something other than binary, iterate through different
possible values. The keyboard can also be used to enter values using the Poke
tool.</p>

<p>When viewing the state of a subcircuit
as described in the `<a href="../../guide/subcirc/debug.html">Debugging
Subcircuits</a>' of the <em>User's Guide</em>,
the value of each input pin is tied ("pinned") to whatever value the subcircuit
is receiving from the containing parent circuit. Manually change the value of
the input pin break this link between the subcircuit's state and the containing
circuit's state, essentially creating a new isolated simulation of just this one
circuit, independent from any parent circuit. In this situation, any attempting
to change the input pin's value using the Poke Tool will cause Logisim to warn
the user and confirm whether breaking this link is actually desired.</p>
