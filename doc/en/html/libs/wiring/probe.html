<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>A probe is an element that simply displays the value at a given point
in a circuit. It does not itself interact with other components.</p>

<p>In most respects, the probe component duplicates the functionality found in a
<a href="pin.html">Pin component</a> configured as an output pin. The difference
is that if the circuit is used as a subcircuit component, then an output pin
will be a part of that interface, whereas a probe is not. They also are
different in that the probe automatically adapts its width to whatever it is
connected to. Graphically, a probe looks like a pin but has a thinner, gray
border and a yellow background.</p>

<h2>Pins</h2>

<p>A probe component has only one pin, which acts as an input to
the probe. The width that this pin accepts is adaptive: The probe will
adapt to inputs of any width.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>When the component is selected or being added,
the arrow keys alter its <q>Facing</q> attribute.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Facing</dt>
<dd>The side of the component where its input pin should be.</dd>

<dt>Label</dt>
<dd>The text within the label associated with the component.</dd>

<dt>Label Location</dt>
<dd>The location of the label relative to the component.</dd>

<dt>Label Font</dt>
<dd>The font with which to render the label.</dd>

<dt>Radix</dt>
<dd>The base (for example, binary, decimal, or hexadecimal) in which
the value is displayed.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Poke Tool Behavior</h2>

<p>None.</p>

<h2>FPGA Synthesis</h2><p>None, but Probe components will be silently
ignored during FPGA synthesis.
