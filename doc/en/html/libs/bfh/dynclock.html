<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>This component only affects FPGA synthesis, and has no effect on the circuit
within Logisim's simulation. It allows for in-circuit or user control of the
FPGA clock speed. Or more specifically, it controls how the synthesized FPGA
circuit derives its clock from the raw FPGA oscillator.</p>

<p>To use the component, place one Dynamic Clock Control component in the
top-level of the circuit. The input to this component controls the clock speed
of the circuit, when synthesized on an FPGA, as follows. The input is
interpreted as an unsigned binary number, between zero and
<var>2<sup><small><var>w</var></small></sup>-1</var>, where <var>w</var> is the
width specified by the Tick Resolution attribute. When the input is zero, all
FPGA clock ticks will be disabled, effectively stopping the clock entirely. When
the input is <var>n &gt; 0</var>, then only one out of every <var>n</var> FPGA
clock ticks will be enabled, giving an effective clock that is only
<var>1/n</var> as fast as the maximum possible clock rate. (Note: the maximum
possible clock rate when using dynamic clock control is actually half the raw
FPGA oscillator speed. So if the FPGA has a 50MHz oscillator, the maximum speed
is 25MHz. When the dynamic clock control input is set to <var>n=1</var>, then
the circuit operates at that speed, but setting it to <var>n=5</var> would
reduct the clock speed to 5MHz.</p>

<blockquote class="hint">Hint: Dynamic Clock Control is nice for teaching demonstrations to
    execute in "slow motion." Pick a few convenient values for the clock speed
    reduction (e.g. slow, fast, faster, and fastest), define these as constants
    feeding into a multiplexer, which in turn feeds into the Dynamic Clock
    Control. With user-facing switches to control the multiplexor, this lets the
    user pick among these speeds to run the FPGA. Here is an example with just
    two choices: slow and "turbo", selectable by the user with a button:

</blockquote>

<p>In order to make use of the Dynamic Clock Control, it must be enabled when
sythesizing the circuit for use in an FPGA. The FPGA Commander window has an
option allowing the user to select a clock speed, which must be set to the
"Dynamic Speed" option.

<h2>Pins</h2>

<p>There is only one pin, an input whose bit width matches the Tick Resolution
attribute. This input determines the clock speed when synthesized for an FPGA.
Zero disables the FPGA clock. Other values divide the clock, with larger values
making the clock slower.
