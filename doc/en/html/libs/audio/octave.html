<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>Octave controls the playback of 12 notes, one full octave on a piano
keyboard. Notes are controlled independently, each with a dedicated pin for each
note to control whether the corresponding sound is playing or not. Note playback
is controlled by a common enable signal and clock trigger, so that audio is
synchronized.

<h2>Pins</h2>

<dl>

<dt>West edge (12 separate inputs, each having bit width 1)</dt>
<dd>Note Inputs: When the clock triggers, and if the component enable is not 0,
the value found at each input is examined. A value of 1 will cause the
corresponding note to be played, as if hitting a piano key. A value of 0, or any
error value, will silence the corresponding note. Thus a constant 1 value for a
note input will cause the note to be triggered fresh on each clock tick, if the
component is enabled.

<dt>South edge, left side (input, bit width 1)</dt>
<dd>Enable: When this value is 0, all other inputs are ignored, but any
previously triggered notes may continue to sound, as if holding a key down on a
piano keyboard. When the enable value is disconnected, or any other value than
0, all notes are immediately silenced, and new values are taken from the Note
Inputs.</dd>

<dt>South edge, right pin marked with triangle (input, bit width 1)</dt>
<dd>Clock: At the instant that this is triggered as specified by the Trigger
attribute, if <em>Enable</em> is not 0, all sounds are silenced and new sounds
are triggered depending on the Note Inputs.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>
<dl>

<dt>Trigger</dt>
<dd>Configures how the clock input is interpreted. The value <q>rising edge</q>
indicates that the register should update its value at the instant when the
clock rises from 0 to 1. The <q>falling edge</q> value indicates that it should
update at the instant the clock falls from 1 to 0.</dd>

<dt>Octave</dt>
<dd>Determines which piano keyboard octave the notes represent. Octave 4
contains a piano keyboard's "middle C" note.
</dd>

<dt>Center on C</dt>
<dd>Determines whether the simulated octave should begin on the C note or A note
for the specified octave. A value of "Yes" corresponds to an octave spanning
from C of the specified octave, to the next higher B. A value of "No"
corresponds to an octave from A to G#.
