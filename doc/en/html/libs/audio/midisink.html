<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>MIDI Sink accepts MIDI audio data provided by a simulated circuit and plays
it back through the native audio system. The MIDI Sink component has data inputs
on the west edge to specify the MIDI note number, velocity, duration, and other
parameters. A write-enable input and a clock input on the south edge control the
timing of playback. When the write-enable input is 1 and the clock is triggered,
the MIDI parameters are captured and sent to the native audio system for
playback, without buffering.

<p>A blue speaker icon indicates that the native audio system is working
properly and accepting data. A red speaker icon indicates playback errors.

<p>A choice of interfaces is provided for how MIDI data is specified, either
serially as a byte stream, in parallel with all MIDI parameters packed
into a single 24-bit or 32-bit value, or as separate values on different pins.

<ul>
    <li><em>"Serial (byte)"</em>: The MIDI Sink has one 8-bit input pin. Data
from this input is a sequence of bytes following standard MIDI stream encoding.
For example, the sequence of bytes 0x91, 0x22, 0x33 encodes a MIDI NoteOn message for
channel 1, note number 0x22, velocity 0x33. This data will take at least three
clock cycles to write, since this MIDI component interface at most one byte of
input per cycle.</li>
    <li><em>"Parallel (24 bits)"</em>: The MIDI Sink has one 24-bit input pin to
specify a MIDI message with size up to 3 bytes, in either big-endian or
little-endian order, formatted as in the standard MIDI stream encoding. In that
encoding, the highest (left-most) bit of each byte is 1 for the initial
"control" byte of a message, and 0 for remaining "parameter" bytes of a message.
This distinction allows for auto-detection of endianness. If the highest
(left-most) bit of the 24-bit input value is 1, the byte order is treated as
big-endian. For example, 0x912233 is interpreted as the byte sequence 0x91,
0x22, 0x33, which encodes MIDI NoteOn message for channel 1, note number 0x22,
velocity 0x33. If the highest (left-most) bit of the 24-bit input value is 0,
the byte order is treated as little-endian. For example, 0x332291 is interpreted
as the byte sequence 0x91, 0x22, 0x33, as before. This interface is more
efficient than the "Serial (byte)" interface, because an entire 3-byte MIDI
message is transferred in a single clock cycle. MIDI messages shorter than
3-bytes must be padded to 24 bits with zeros, however.</li>
    <li><em>"Parallel (32 bits)"</em>: The MIDI Sink has one 32-bit input pin to
specify a MIDI message with size up to 3 bytes, in either big-endian or
little-endian order, formatted as in the standard MIDI stream encoding. This
interface is identical to the "Parallel (24 bits)" interface, except that all
messages must be padded with an extra zero byte. This interface is for
convenience, e.g. when building 32-bit CPU-like circuits.
    <li><em>"Logisim (32 bits)"</em>: The MIDI Sink has one 32-bit input pin
        which specifies playback (or release) of a single MIDI note. The format is:<br>
        <tt>xxxD CCCC IIII IIII xVVV VVVV NNNN NNNN</tt><br>
        where:
<ul>
    <li>D is a 1-bit "Damper" control. If set to 1, all notes on this channel
        are silenced so that any new note is played in isolation.</li>
    <li>CCCC is the 4-bit MIDI channel number to be used. If unconnected, the
        <em>Channel</em> attribute is used as a default.</li>
    <li>IIIIIIIII is the 8-bit MIDI instrument to be used for notes. If left
        unconnected, the <em>Instrument</em> attribute is used as a
        default.</li>
    <li>VVVVVVVV is a 7-bit attack (or release) velocity number.</li>
    <li>NNNNNNNNN is an 8-bit note number specifying the MIDI note to be played
        (or released) as a signed two's complement number. Values 1 to 127 play
        a note (NoteOn). If the <em>Auto Hold Time</em> attribute is set to a
        non-zero value, the note will automatically be released after that many
        milliseconds. To manually release a note (NoteOff), negative note
        numbers can be used, for example, -60 will release note 60. A note value
        of zero is ignored.</li>
</ul>
    <li><em>"Logisim (8+7+1+4+8 bits)"</em>: The MIDI Sink has five input pins,
all of which together specify playback (or release) of a MIDI note. All inputs
take effect together when the component is enabled and the clock is triggered.
<ul>
    <li><em>Channel</em> input: The MIDI channel number to be used. If left
        unconnected, the <em>Channel</em> attribute is used as a default.</li>
    <li><em>Input</em> input: The MIDI channel instrument to be used for notes.
        If left unconnected, the <em>Instrument</em> attribute is used as a
        default.</li>
    <li><em>Damper</em> input: if set to 1, all notes on this channel are silenced
        so that any new note is played in isolation.
    <li><em>Note</em> input: The note to be played (or released). Values 1 to
        127 play a note (NoteOn). If the <em>Auto Hold Time</em> attribute is
        set to a non-zero value, the note will automatically be released after
        that many milliseconds. To manually release a note, negative note
        numbers can be used, for example, -60 will release note 60. A note value
        of zero is ignored.</li>
    <li><em>Velocity</em> input: The attack (or release) velocity.</li>
        the attack (or release) velocity.</li>
</ul>
