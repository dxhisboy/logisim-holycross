<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>PCM Sink converts digital PCM data provided by a circuit, in real-time, into
an analog audio signal for playback using the native audio system. It includes
an internal data buffer to account for slight variations in Logisim's simulation
speed or slight mismatches between the simulation tick rate and the intended
audio playback rate. The PCM Sink component has a data input on the west edge, a
write-enable input on the south edge, and a clock input on the south edge. When
the write-enable input is 1 and the clock is triggered, one new data value is
captured at the data input and added to the playback buffer. At all times,
whenever the playback buffer is not empty, the audio data in the buffer is
removed from the buffer at a steady rate, converted to analog audio, and played
through the speakers or other system audio output. If the playback buffer is
full, new data is ignored.

<p>The amount of data in the playback buffer, as a fraction of the buffer's
total capacity, is shown as an overlay on the PCM Sink component, with the gray
bar indicating pending data to be played and the white color indicating empty
space in the buffer for more data. A blue speaker icon indicates that data is
being converted and played as audio. When the buffer is empty or overflows, when
the clock is stopped, or if there are any errors in playback, the speaker icon
will show as red.

<blockquote class="hint"><b>Simulation Tick Rate:</b> Because audio data must be
feed to the the sound system at a fixed rate, you must set Logisim's simulation
clock tick rate and the PCM Sink's Sample Rate attribute to match. If the simulation tick
rate runs faster than the PCM audio Sample Rate, the playback buffer will
overflow and audible glitches will be heard. If the simulation runs slower than
the PCM audio Sample Rate, the playback buffer will nearly always be empty,
resulting in little or no audio produced.

<h2>Pins</h2>

<dl>

<dt>West edge (input, bit width matches Data Bits attribute)</dt>
<dd>Sample: When the clock triggers, the value found at this input is copied
into the the real-time audio playback buffer. If the value contains undefined or
error bits, the entire sample value is discarded.</dd>

<dt>South edge, left side (input, bit width 1)</dt>
<dd>Write Enable: When this value is 1, clock triggers and audio data sampling
and playback is enabled. When the value is 0, the <em>Sample</em> and
<em>Clock</em> inputs are ignored.</dd>

<dt>South edge, right pin marked with triangle (input, bit width 1)</dt>
<dd>Clock: At the instant that this is triggered as specified by the
Trigger attribute, the component adds the <em>Sample</em> input value, if it is
fully defined and not an error value, to the playback buffer for conversion and
audio playback.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>When the component is selected or being added,
Alt-0 through Alt-9 alter its <q>Data Bits</q> attribute.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Trigger</dt>
<dd>Configures how the clock input is interpreted. The value <q>rising edge</q>
indicates that the register should update its value at the instant when the
clock rises from 0 to 1. The <q>falling edge</q> value indicates that it should
update at the instant the clock falls from 1 to 0.</dd>

<dt>Sample Rate</dt>
<dd>The rate at which the audio playback system will be configured. Logisim's
tick rate should be configured to match this value.</dd>

<dt>Data Bits</dt>
<dd>The bit width of the <em>Sample</em> value.</dd>

<dt>Numeric Type</dt>
<dd>The format for the <em>Sample</em> value, either signed twos complement or
unsigned.</dd>

<dt>Buffer Capacity</dt>
<dd>The capacity, in number of samples, of the audio playback system. This
provides buffering to account for differences between the audio playback
rate, defined by the Sample Rate attribute, and Logisim's simulation tick rate,
which can vary unpredictably depending on many factors. However, larger buffer
capacity can also result in higher latency, a lag between when data is captured
from the <em>Sample</em> pin and when it is played back as audio.</dd>
