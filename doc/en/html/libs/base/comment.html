<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>The Comment Tool adds free-form text comments to a circuit. It is a limited
and less useful version of the <a class="icon" href="text.html"><img
    src="../../../icons/text.gif"> Text Tool</a>, as it can't edit labels on
components, and the user interface for this tool is awkward.</p>

<p>To use this tool, first select the tool, then enter the desired text in the
'Text' attribute in the attrbutes panel at the bottom left. Then click anywhere
on the circuit to insert a comment with that text.</p>

<p>In contrast to all other components in the current built-in libraries,
comments can be placed anywhere on the canvas; they do not snap to the grid.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Text</dt>
<dd>The text appearing in the comment. This can be edited by changing the
attribute in the attribute table, or using the <a class="icon"
href="text.html"><img src="../../../icons/text.gif"> Text Tool</a> directly the
canvas.</dd>

<dt>Font</dt>
<dd>The font used for the comment.</dd>

<dt>Horizontal Alignment</dt>
<dd>Controls the horizontal alignment, as well as where the text appears relative to
the origin (i.e. where the mouse was clicked when creating the comment).  "Left"
uses left-alignment, and positions the text so its left edge is at the origin.
"Right" uses right-alignment, and positions the text so its right edge is at the
origin. "Center" horizontally centers each line, and positions the text
horizontally so the center is at the origin.</dd>

<dt>Vertical Alignment</dt>
<dd>Controls the where the text appears relative to the origin (i.e. where the
mouse was clicked when creating the comment). "Base" positions the text so the
origin is at the baseline of the first line of text. "Top" positions the text so
the origin is at the top of first line of the text. "Bottom" positions the text
so the origin is at the bottom of the first line of text. "Center" centers the
first line of text vertically at the origin.
NOTE: For legacy reasons, when
there are multiple lines of text, vertical alignment is relative to the
<i>first</i> line of text, never to the last line or to the entire block of
text. </dd>

<h2>FPGA Synthesis</h2><p>Comments are silently during FPGA synthesis.
