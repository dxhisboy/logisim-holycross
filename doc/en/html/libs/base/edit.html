<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>The Multi-Tool allows the user to select and rearrange existing components,
and to add, move, and rearrange wires. Exactly what the tool does depends on
where the user presses the mouse on the canvas. This tool is a combination of
the <a class="icon" href="select.html"><img src="../../../icons/move.gif"> Move Tool</a> and
the <a class="icon" href="wiring.html"><img src="../../../icons/wiring.gif"> Wiring Tool</a>.
</p>

<h3>Drawing Wires</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><img class="nonicon" src="multi-wire-anim.gif" style="float: right; border: 1px solid gray;">
When the mouse is over a wiring point for an existing component,
or if it is atop a current wire, the Multi-Tool will display a small green circle
around the mouse's location. Clicking and dragging will create new wire
segments. All wires in Logisim are either horizontal or vertical, never
diagonal, but logisim will create an "L" shaped sequence of wire segments for
you if you drag diagonally.</p>
<blockquote class="hint"> Hint: <b>Press space while dragging to bend a wire's path.</b>.
    You can do this repeatedly to make a complicated zig-zag
    path for the wire by pressing space at each place the wire should turn a
    corner. <b>Press backspace while dragging to straighten a wire's path</b>.
    Each backspace will remove a corner point resulting in fewer turns and a
    more direct path. </blockquote></li>


<li><p><img class="nonicon" src="multi-wire-extend-anim.gif" style="float: right; border: 1px solid gray;">
Click and drag the end of a wire to shorten or extend it, or click and drag
the middle of a wire segment and drag along the wire to open a gap.</p></li>

<li><p>Hover over the wiring point of a component to see a description of that
input or output.</p>
</ul>

<p>Some components draw short stubs near the points to which wires can connect,
such as the <a href="../gates/basic.html">OR gate</a> and <a
href="../gates/controlled.html">controlled buffer</a>. Logisim will silently
correct attempts to create wires that slightly overshoot the stub's
end.</p></li>

<h3>Selecting, Moving, and Editing</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><img class="nonicon" src="multi-select-anim.gif" style="float: right; border: 1px solid gray;">
A simple click on wire or a component, without dragging, will simply
select the the component or wire segment. Holding <span class="key">shift</span>
while clicking a wire or component will add it to the current selection if it
was not there already, or will remove it if it was. After selecting the desired
items in the selection, you can of course cut/copy/paste/delete/duplicate all
the items via the <a href="../../guide/menu/edit.html">Edit menu</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Click then drag the mouse on the background (i.e. starting at a location
not contained within any components) to begin a rectangular selection. All
components that are fully contained by the rectangle will be selected. Holding
<span class="key">shift</span> while making a rectanglar selection will add the
new elements if they were not there already, or will remove them if they
were.</p></li>

<li><p>Clicking and dragging a currently-selected component or wire segment will
begin moving all elements of the selection.</p>

<p>By default, Logisim will compute a way to add new wires, or remove or shorten
existing wires, so that no existing connections are lost during the move.
If you're performing a move where you do not want these changes to be made, you
can press the <span class="key">shift</span> key during the move. If you want to
disable this behavior entirely, go to Project &gt; Options, select the Canvas
tab, and uncheck the <q>Keep Connections When Moving</q> box; in this case, the
connections are computed only when the <span class="key">shift</span> key
<em>is</em> down.</p>

<blockquote>
    Note: <b>Dragging a selection containing wires</b> can somteimes lead to
    surprises. If you drag a selection including some wires on top of some other
    wires, all wires are merged, and the newly-merged wires are added the
    selection.  As a result, if you then drag the selection a second time, the
    wires previously at the location will not be left behind. This behavior is
    in keeping with the rule in Logisim that wires never overlap. And it does
    not normally constitute a major problem: Logisim will draw the full
    selection in the midst of dropping, and you should not drop it until you are
    sure it is in the correct location.</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Some keys have an effect when items have been selected.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Rotate components</b> using the arrow keys 
<span class="key">Up</span>
<span class="key">Down</span>
<span class="key">Left</span>
<span class="key">Right</span>. This 
changes the Facing attribute for all components in the
selection that have such an attribute.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Remove components and wires</b> using 
<span class="key">Delete</span> or
<span class="key">Backspace</span> keys.
These will delete everything selected from the circuit.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Duplicate components and wires</b> using the
<span class="key">Insert</span> key. This will create a duplicate of all
currently-selected wires and components. </p></li>

</ul>

<p>When duplicating a selection or pasting, Logisim does not immediately place
the new components into the circuit; instead, the selection will be a collection
of "ghosts," which will be dropped into the circuit as soon as they are either
deselected or dragged to another location.</p>

<h3>Obsolete/Broken Features</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Pressing the <span class="key">Alt</span> key when clicking causes the click to be ignored.
<strike>If, however, the user presses the <span class="key">Alt</span> key at a point in the middle of
the wire, then the green circle will disappear. A mouse press selects the wire,
and a mouse drag moves it.</strike></p></li>

<li><p><strike>However, if the <span class="key">Alt</span> key is pressed at a location not contained within
any components, this initiates the addition of a new wire. A small green circle
is drawn in such a circumstance to indicate this.</strike></p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>None. Selecting a component, though, will display its attributes.
With multiple components selected, attributes shared by all are shown,
blank if they have different values and otherwise with the value they
all have in common. (Wires are ignored if there are any non-wires in
the selection.) Changes to the attribute value affect all selected
components.</p>
