<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>This tool adds images to a circuit, which can be useful for including
diagrams and other visuals for documentation purposes.

<p>Image data can be embedded within the project. This is simple and convenient,
but may make for very large project files if the embedded images are large or
high-resolution. Alternatively, the Logisim project can store only a link to a
separate image file, which must then be kept alongside the project file. In this
case, you can update the separate image file at any time, including while
viewing the project in Logisim&emdash;the image shown in the circuit will update
after a short delay, as soon as Logisim notices the external file has changed.

<p>Limitation: The size scale of an image can't yet be adjusted within Logisim,
the image is always shown at 100% size without cropping.
Images do not normally "snap to grid" on the canvas. While moving a callout, you
can hold the ALT key (or option on MacOS) to force "snap to grid" behavior.

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Image</dt>
<dd>Click this to choose a PNG or JPG/JPEG image file. After selecting a file,
you can choose to embed the image data within your project, or store only a
link to the file.</dd>

<dt>Label</dt>
<dd>A text label appearing near the image.
This can be edited by changing the
attribute in the attribute table, or using the <a class="icon"
href="text.html"><img src="../../../icons/text.gif"> Text Tool</a> directly the
canvas.</dd>

<dt>Label Location</dt>
<dd>Where to place the label, if any, relative to the image.</dd>

<dt>Label Font</dt>
<dd>The font used for the image label.</dd>

<dt>Label Color</dt>
<dd>The color used for the image label.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>Currently supports only PNG or JPG/JPEG images.

<p>Currently supports only local files. Linking to a URL is not supported, for example.

<h2>FPGA Synthesis</h2><p>Images are silently during FPGA synthesis.
