<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>A PLA, or Programmable Logic Array, is essentially a configurable universal
truth table. It is configured by either right-clicking and selecting "Edit PLA
Program..." or clicking 'Program' in the attribute list. Within the program
editor, each line specifies a pattern of ones, zeros, and 'X' values (for "don't
care"), a corresponding output pattern, and (optionally) a comment or note.

<p>If any input bit to the PLA is floating (i.e. unknown) or an error, then the
every output bit of the PLA is an error value.

<p><img style="float: right;" src="../../../img-libs/pla-editor.png">The value
at the input pin is compared to each of the rows of the table. When a matching
row is found, the output specified by that row is used as the output for the
PLA. Unlike an actual truth-table, rows are matched in the order they are
written, so they do not need to be mutually exclusive: if multiple rows match
the input, only the first matching row will be used to determine the output. Nor
do the rows need to be exhaustive: if no rows match, the output will be all
zeros.

<p>The PLA program editor additionally allows the table to be be exported to or
imported from a text file. The format is straightforward, for example:
<blockquote class="plain"><pre># Logisim PLA program table
1xx 01 # first case
01x 01 # my favorite case
001 01
001 10 # fallback case</pre></blockquote>
Lines starting with '#' are ignored. Other lines specify a row of the PLA
program, with input first, followed by output, then an optional comment
preceeded by a '#' character.

<p>The comments on each row of the PLA program have no effect on the circuit
simulation, but they can be useful for documenting the rationale behind each row
of the program, much like comments in a programming language. However, the
comment for the current matching row is also displayed on the PLA component
itself during the simulation. This can be useful for debugging, or simply for
displaying information to the user about what the circuit is doing. 

<blockquote>Bonus feature: If you include a '#' symbol <em>within</em> a
    comment, only the part before the '#' will appear on the PLA during the
    simulation. That way you can include a short label for each row, and a
    longer comment for documentation.</blockquote>

<h2>Pins (assuming component faces east, control line right-handed)</h2>

<dl>

<dt>West edge (input, bit width matches Bit Width In attribute)</dt>
<dd>The component input that will be used to match against rows in the PLA
program.</dd>

<dt>East edge (output, bit width matches Bit Width Out attribute)</dd>
<dd>The component's output, as determined by the PLA program, or and error value
if the input was not well-defined.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>When the component is selected or being added,
the arrow keys alter its <q>Facing</q> attribute.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Facing</dt>
<dd>The direction of the component (its output relative to its input).</dd>

<dt>Bit Width In</dt>
<dd>The bit width of the component's input.</dd>

<dt>Bit Width Out</dt>
<dd>The bit width of the component's output.</dd>

<dt>Program</dt>
<dd>The PLA program that specifies the relation between input and output.</dd>

<dt>Label</dt>
<dd>The text within the label associated with the gate.</dd>

<dt>Label Font</dt>
<dd>The font with which to render the label.</dd>
