<h1>Memory Import/Export Format</h1>

<p>The contents of RAM and ROM components can be exported to an external file,
or imported from an external file. These actions can be accessed by
right-clicking a memory component, or from the integrated hex editor. A variety
of file formats are supported. Most are identified by their first line, which
usually says "v3.0" followed by tags that specify various decoding options. The
options control various decisions:
<ul>
    <li><p><b>Encoding/Notation</b>&mdash;How the file is decoded into a stream
    of bits. As raw uninterpreted binary data? As ascii or utf-8 characters? Or
    as hex digits (written in ascii, but each interpreted as specifying a 4-bit
    hex value)?
    <li><p><b>Grouping of bits</b>&mdash;How is the decoded stream of bits split into
    groups, each of a size appropriate for one memory cell. In most cases, the
    bit stream is just split up into consecutive groups of <var>w</var> bits,
    where <var>w</var> is the width of a memory cell. Note that when
    <var>w</var> is not an even multiiple of four or eight, then the boundaries
    between groupings won't correspond to the boundaries between hex digits or
    bytes: that is, in most cases Logisim treats the data as a stream of
    <em>bits</em>, not a stream of <em>hex digits</em> or <em>bytes</em>.
    <li><p><b>Endianness</b>&mdash;How is each group of bits assembled into a
    single value for one memory cell. When the width <var>w</var> of a memory
    cell is 8 bits or less, and in big-endian modes, then the of the stream bits
    are always packed into values from most-significant (left) to
    least-significant (right) bit.  When the width <var>w</var> of a memory cell
    is more than 8 bits and a little-endian mode is used, the ordering is more
    complex: sets of eight bits are put together whenever possible into bytes of the memory word,
    start with the least significant byte, with smaller sets used to fil. the
    most significant partial byte when necessary.
</ul>

<p>For memory components configured to hold bytes (8-bit values), the grouping and
endianness are irrelevant, making most of the formats and options described
below superfluous. But in other cases, when memory is configured to hold large
values (e.g. 32-bits per word) or unusually-sized values (e.g. 5-bits per word),
then the grouping and endianness values matter.

<h2>Endianness</h2>

<p>In several of the formats described below, the endianness can affect how bits
are packed into memory cells.

<p><b>Big-endian conversion:</b>
If we have 3-bit memory words, then the first 7 bytes
of an imported file corresponds to around 7*8/3 = 18.6 memory words like so:
<blockquote><pre>
  file bytes: |1......|2......|3......|4......|5......|6......|7......|
memory words: |1.|2.|3.|4.|5.|6.|7.|8.|9.|A.|B.|C.|D.|E.|F.|0.|1.|2.|
</pre></blockquote>
<p>If instead have 9-bit words, then the first 7 bytes
corresponds to around 7*8/9 = 6.2 words like so:
<blockquote><pre>
  file bytes: |1......|2......|3......|4......|5......|6......|7......|
memory words: |1.......|2.......|3.......|4.......|5.......|6.......|
</pre></blockquote>
<p>And if we have 16-bit words, then the first 7 bytes
corresponds to around 7*8/16 = 3.5 words like so:
<blockquote><pre>
  file bytes: |1......|2......|3......|4......|5......|6......|7......|
memory words: |1..............|2..............|3..............|
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Little-endian conversion:</b>
If we have 3-bit words, then the first 7 bytes
corresponds to around 7*8/3 = 18.6 words like so:
<blockquote><pre>
  file bytes: |7......|6......|5......|4......|3......|2......|1......|
memory words:   |2.|1.|0.|F.|E.|D.|C.|B.|A.|9.|8.|7.|6.|5.|4.|3.|2.|1.|
</pre></blockquote>
<p>If instead have 9-bit words, then the first 7 bytes
corresponds to around 7*8/9 = 6.2 words like so:
<blockquote><pre>
  file bytes: |7......|6......|5......|4......|3......|2......|1......|
memory words:   |6.......|5.......|4.......|3.......|2.......|1.......|
</pre></blockquote>
<p>And if we have 16-bit words, then the first 7 bytes
corresponds to around 7*8/16 = 3.5 words like so:
<blockquote><pre>
  file bytes: |7......|6......|5......|4......|3......|2......|1......|
memory words:         |3..............|2..............|1..............|
</pre></blockquote>

<h2>Hex Bytes Plain</h2>

<blockquote><span class="key">v3.0 hex bytes plain [big-endian|little-endian]</span> 
A sequence of hex digits, spread out with as much whitespace desired (the parser
is a bit forgiving and will ignore "0x" prefixes). The hex digits are assembled
into a stream of bits and these are then broken up into word-sized chunks and
used to fill the locations of memory. Anything on a line after a "#" is ignored.
The file must be encoded using utf-8 or plain ascii.
</blockquote>

<p>Example:
<blockquote class="note"><pre>v3.0 hex bytes plain big-endian
a2b300000000000000000001aaba00f000000000000000000000000000000000 # a comment

00 00000 00000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 # whitespace optional
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
</blockquote>

<p>This is the same format as used by the Linux "<tt>xxd --plain</tt>"
command. Note that whitespace between the hex digits is ignored, having no
impact on how the file is decoded. Instead, all of the file data together is
taken as a single contiguous stream of bits before being grouped into word-sized
chunks.

<p>If loaded into a memory component with 4-bit values, each hex digit in the
above example would be used to fill one location in the memory (with <tt>0xa</tt> in the
first location, <tt>0x2</tt> in the next location, <tt>0xb</tt> in the next,
etc.) If the memory is 8-bits wide instead, then pairs of hex digits are used to
fill the locations: <tt>0xa2</tt>, then <tt>0xb3</tt>, etc. 

<p>Memory components can be configured to be a width that is not a multiple of
four, so the hex digits in the file do not always correspond neatly to memory
locations. For example, if the above file were loaded into a memory component
configured to use words that are only 2 bits wide, then the first hex digit will
fill up two locations in the memory (with the high-order bits going in the first
location, and the low-order bits going in the second location). 
<blockquote><pre>            hex:  a  |  2  |  b  |  3  |  0  | ...
         binary: 1010  0010  1011  0011  0000  ...
memory location: 0011  2233  4455  6677  8899  ...
</blockquote>
<p>If, on the other hand, the same contents are loaded into a memory component
with values that are 10 bits wide, the first two and a half hex digits will go
into location zero, the remainder of the third digit with two more hex digits
will specify the value of location one, etc.
<blockquote><pre>            hex:  a  |  2  |  b  |  3  |  0  | ...
         binary: 1010  0010  1011  0011  0000  ...
memory location: 0000  0000  0011  1111  1111  ...
</blockquote>
<p>In some oddly-sized memory cases, a few leftover zero bits in the
file, if needed, will be silently ignored. 

<p>If memory words are larger than 8 bits, then by default the ordering will be
"big-endian", so the first byte in the file ends up in the most significant 8
bits of the memory location. The "little-endian" option would instead cause the
first byte in the file to end up in the least significant 8 bits of the memory
location. For memory words of size 8 bits or less, the endianness is irrelevant.

addresses, not <em>word</em> addresses. The addresses need not be in increasing
order, and you can leave gaps, which will be filled with zeros. Anything on a
line after a "#" is ignored. Anything after two consecutive whitespaces will
also be ignored. The file must be encoded using utf-8 or plain ascii.

<p>This format is compatible with the default output format of the Linux
"<tt>xxd</tt>" command. Note that the whitespace between groups of four hex
digits in the example above is optional and has no impact on the meaning of the
file. As with "v3.0 hex plain", the bits specified in the file are considered as
taken together a single large stream of bits, and then grouped in word-sized
chunks to fill memory. The meaning of the "little-endian" and "big-endian" tags
is the same as above, with the default ordering again being "big-endian".

<h2>Hex Words Plain</h2>

<blockquote><span class="key">v3.0 hex words plain</span>

taken as a single word and put into a single location in memory. Anything after

<p>This format is similar to "v3.0 hex bytes plain" except that whitespace
between hex digits is significant, with each whitespace-separated group of
digits filling a single memory location. If memory words are 10 bits wide, then
each group of hex digits should range from 000 to 3ff, and if memory words are 2
bits wide, then each group should range from 0 to 3.

<p>Endianness is irrelevant for this format.

<h2>Hex Bytes</h2>

<blockquote><span class="key">v3.0 hex bytes</span> This attempts to (partially)
auto-detect the format. If the file contains ":", then "v3.0 hex bytes
addressed" will be used, otherwise "v3.0 hex bytes plain" will be
used.</blockquote>

<h2>Hex Words</h2>

<blockquote><span class="key">v3.0 hex words</span> This attempts to (partially)
auto-detect the format. If the file contains ":", then "v3.0 hex words
addressed" will be used, otherwise "v3.0 hex words plain" will be
used.</blockquote>

<h2>Binary</h2>

<blockquote>Raw binary format. Each byte of the file is taken as-is. There is no
header on the first line, no comments, and no provisions for endoding or
decoding. The bytes (or partial bytes) from the file are packed into the memory
words, in either big-endian or little-endian order.</blockquote>

<p>Example: Literally any file.</p>

<p>For memory components with width different from 8, bits are packed into the
words in a manner similar to "v3.0 hex bytes" formats, described above. For
example, if memory words are 20 bits each, for big-endian the first byte of the
file will be put into the most signficant 8 bits of the memory word, the next
byte will go into the middle 8 bits of the memory word, and the most significant
4 bits of the third byte of the file will go into the bottom 4 bits of the
memory word.

<h2>Escaped ASCII</h2>

<blockquote>No header line, and no comments. Each byte of the file is taken
as-is, except that bytes that are not regular printable ascii must be escaped
using simple (C-style or Java-style) escapes or hex escape sequences. Any
non-printable ascii found in the file will be silently ignored, such such as
newlines, tabs, emoji, or other unusual unicode characters, and any other bytes
outside the ASCII range 0x20 - 0x7E.</blockquote>

<p>Example:
<blockquote class="note"><pre>Hello
World\n\0</blockquote>

<p>In this example, the file specifies 12 bytes (<tt>H e l l o W o r l d newline
zero</tt>), each of which is turned into 8-bits according to the ASCII
specification (<tt>48 65 6c 6c 6f 57 6f 72 6c 64 0a 00</tt>). As can be seen in
this example, C-style and Java-style escapes are acceptable (such as "\n" for
newline, "\t" for tab, and "\0" for the nul character). In addition, hex escapes
such as "\xA1" are allowed.

<p>For memory components with width different from 8, bits are packed into the
words in a manner similar to "v3.0 hex bytes" formats, described above. For
example, if memory words are 20 bits each, for big-endian the first byte of the
file will be put into the most signficant 8 bits of the memory word, the next
byte will go into the middle 8 bits of the memory word, and the most significant
4 bits of the third byte of the file will go into the bottom 4 bits of the
memory word.


<h2>Legacy format: v2.0 raw</h2>

<blockquote><span class="key">v2.0 raw</span> A sequence of space-sparated hex numbers (without "0x"), each
optionally prefixed with a decimal count and a "*", spread out on as many lines
as desired. Anything on a line after a "#" is ignored. The file must be encoded
using utf-8 or plain ascii.</blockquote>

<p>The "v2.0 raw" format is the original Logisim file format for storing memory
contents. It is intentionally simple, permiting you to write simple programs to
generate memory images that can then be loaded into Logisim memory components.
As an example of this file format, if we had a 256-byte memory whose first five
bytes were 2, 3, 0, 20, and -1, and all subsequent values were 0, then "v2.0
raw" format memory image would be the following text file:</p>
<blockquote class="note"><pre>v2.0 raw
02
03
00
14
ff
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The first line identifies the file format. Subsequent values list the values
in hexadecimal, starting from address 0; you can place several such values on
the same line if you prefer. Each number corresponds to one location in the
resulting memory. For example, if the memory uses words that are 10 bits wide,
each number should be in the range 0-1023, and if the memory words are only 2
bits wide, each number should be in the range 0-3. If there are more memory
locations than are identified in the file, Logisim will load 0 into the other
memory locations.</p>

<p>The "v2.0 raw" format also supports a simple form of run-length encoding; for
example, rather than list the value <tt>00</tt> sixteen times in a row, the file
can include <tt>16*00</tt>. Notice than the number of repetitions is written in
base 10. Files exported by Logisim will use run-length encoding for runs of at
least four values.</p>

<p>You can place comments into a "v2.0 raw" format file using the '#' symbol:
All characters in the line starting from the '#' symbol will be ignored by
Logisim. As an example, here is a memory image containing 32-bit values:</p>
<blockquote class="note"><pre>v2.0 raw
10*0 1000000 # ten consecutive values of 0x00000000, followed by 0x1000000
2            # same as 0x0000002
5 6 A3B      # three more 32-bit numbers
15*f000baaa  # another 32-bit number, repeated fifteen times
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Logisim's "v2.0 raw" parser is a bit forgiving, and actually accepts any text
that can get past Java's <tt>Long.parseLong(text, 16)</tt> function.
