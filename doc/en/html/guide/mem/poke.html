<h1>Poking memory</h1>

<p>Clicking a RAM or ROM component with the Poke Tool brings keyboard and mouse
focus to the component (indicated by a red rectangle), allowing for the contents
to be viewed or edited. Because Poke Tool editing all takes place within a very
small space, the interface for this is severely but necessarily constrained. For
all but the simplest editing, it is more convenient to right-click the RAM and
select "Edit Contents..." to bring up the <a href="hex.html">integrated hex
editor</a>.</p>

<p>The Poke Tool has two modes of operation: You can edit the address displayed,
and you can edit an individual value at some memory location.</p>

<p><b>Editing Addresses:</b> Use the Poke Tool and click anywhere within the
memory component but <em>outside</em> the gray box holding the memory contents.
Logisim will draw a red rectangle around the address at the upper left corner.
From here:
<ul>
    <li><p>Typing <span class="key">R</span> or <span class="key">r</span> will
    clear the contents of memory.</li>
    <li><p>Typing hex digits will change the address (assuming the new address
    isn't too large) and scroll the memory contents to show that address.</li>
    <li><p>Scrolling with the mouse wheel increments or decrements the address
    and scrolls the memory forward or backward.
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Down</span> (or <span class="key">Enter</span>)
    key will increment the address and scroll the memory contents forward by one
    row.</li>
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Up</span> (or <span class="key">Backspace</span>
    or <span class="key">Delete</span>) keys will also increment or decrement
    the address to key will decrement the address and scroll the memory contents
    backwards by one row.</li>
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Page Down</span> (or <span
        class="key">Space</span>) and <span class="key">Page Up</span> keys will
    increment or decrement the address to scroll the memory contents forward or
    backward by one full page.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Editing Contents:</b> Use the Poke Tool and click anywhere within the
memory component <em>within</em> the gray box holding the memory contents.
Logisim will draw a red rectangle around the memory cell currently being
edited. From here:
<ul>
    <li><p>Typing <span class="key">R</span> or <span class="key">r</span> will
    clear the contents of memory.</li>
    <li><p>Typing hex digits will change the contents of that cell.</li>
    <li><p>Scrolling with the mouse wheel moves up or down to an adjacent memory
    cell.</li>
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Up</span>, <span class="key">Down</span>, <span
        class="key">Left</span>, and <span class="key">Right</span> arrow keys
    move to an adjacent memory cell.
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Page Up</span> and <span class="key">Page
        Down</span> keys move up or down by a full page.
    <li><p>The <span class="key">Backspace</span> (or <span
        class="key">Delete</span>) and <span class="key">Tab</span> (or <span
        class="key">Space</span>) keys similarly move to the previous or next
    memory cell.</li>
</ul>
