The first thing we'll do\nis to add the two AND gates. Click on the AND tool in the toolbar\n(, the\nnext-to-last tool listed).\nThen click in the editing area where\nyou want the first AND gate to go. Be sure to leave plenty of room\nfor stuff on the left. Then click the AND tool again and place the second\nAND gate below it.\nNotice the five dots on the left side of the AND gate. These are spots\nwhere wires can be attached. It happens that we'll just use two of them\nfor our XOR circuit; but for other circuits, you may find that having\nmore than two wires going to an AND gate is useful.\nNow add the other gates.\nFirst click on the OR tool\n();\nthen click where you want it. And place the two NOT gates into the canvas\nusing the NOT tool\n().\nI left a little space between the NOT gates and the AND gates; if you\nwant to, though, you can put them up against each other and save\nyourself the effort of connecting them with a wire later.\nNow we want to add the two inputs x and y into\nthe diagram. Select the Input tool\n(),\nand place the pins down.\nYou should also place an output pin next to the OR gate's output using\nthe Output tool\n().\n(Again, I'm leaving a bit of space between the OR gate and the output\npin, but you might choose to place them right next to each other.)\nIf you decide you don't like where you placed something, then you can\nselect it using the Edit tool\n()\nand drag it to the desired spot. Or you can delete it altogether by selecting\nDelete from the Edit menu or pressing the Delete key.\nAs you place each component of the circuit, you'll notice that as soon as\nthe component is placed, Logisim reverts to the Edit tool so that you can\nmove the recently-placed component or (as we'll see soon) connect the component\nto others by creating wires. If you want to add a copy of the recently placed\ncomponent, a shortcut is to press Control-D to duplicate the selection.\n(Some computers use another keys for menus, such as the Command key on\nMacintoshes. You would press that key with the D key.)"

Select the Edit Tool\n().\nWhen the cursor is over a point that receives a wire, a small green circle\nwill be drawn around it. Press the mouse button there and drag as far as you\nwant the wire to go.\nLogisim is rather intelligent when adding wires: Whenever a wire ends at\nanother wire, Logisim automatically connects them. You can also \"extend\" or\n\"shorten\" a wire by dragging one of its endpoints using the edit tool.\nWires in Logisim must be horizontal or vertical. To connect the upper\ninput to the NOT gate and the AND gate, then, I added three\ndifferent wires.\nLogisim automatically connects wires to the gates\nand to each other. This includes automatically drawing the circle at\na T intersection as above, indicating that the\nwires are connected.\nAs you draw wires, you may see some blue or gray wires. Blue in Logisim\nindicates that the value at that point is \"unknown,\" and gray\nindicates that the wire is not connected to anything.\nThis is not a big\ndeal as you're in the process of building a circuit. But by the time you finish\nit, none of your wires should be blue or gray. (The unconnected legs of the OR\ngate will still be blue: That's fine.)\nIf you do have a blue or a gray wire after you think everything\nought to be connected, then something is going wrong.\nIt's important\nthat you connect wires to the right places. Logisim draws little dots\non the components to indicate where wires ought to connect. As you\nproceed, you'll see the dots turn from blue to light or dark green.\nOnce you have all the wires connected, all of the wires you inserted\nwill themselves be light or dark green."

Each time you poke an input, its value will\ntoggle.\nFor example, we might first poke the bottom input.\nWhen you change the input value, Logisim will show you what values\ntravel down the wires by drawing them light green to indicate a 1 value\nor dark green (almost black) to indicate a 0 value. You can also see\nthat the output value has changed to 1.\nSo far, we have tested the first two rows of our truth table, and the\noutputs (0 and 1) match the desired outputs.\nBy poking the switches through different combinations, we can verify the\nother two rows.

You can see that Logisim now stands ready to add NAND gates into the\ncircuit.\nIf you look through the choices in the Gates library, you'll notice that\nthere was no need for us to develop a XOR circuit earlier: It's built\ninto Logisim.\nWhen you create a project, it automatically includes several libraries:\nWiring: Components that interact directly with wires.\nGates: Components that perform simple logic functions.\nPlexers: More complex combinational components, like multiplexers and\ndecoders.\nArithmetic: Components that perform arithmetic.\nMemory: Components that remember data, like flip-flops, registers, and\nRAM.\nI/O: Components that exist for the purpose of interacting with the\nuser.\nBase: Tools that are integral to using Logisim, though you probably won't\nneed to dig into this library very often.\nLogisim allows you to add more libraries, too, using the Load Library submenu\nof the Project menu.\nYou can see that Logisim has three categories of libraries.\nBuilt-in libraries are libraries that are\ndistributed with Logisim. These are documented in the\nLibrary Reference.\nLogisim libraries are projects built\nwithin Logisim and saved to the disk as a Logisim project. You can develop a\nset of circuits in a single project (as described in the\nSubcircuits section of this guide)\nand then use that set of circuits as a library for other projects.\nJAR libraries are libraries that are developed\nin Java but not distributed with Logisim.\nYou can download JAR\nlibraries that others have written, or you can write your own as\ndescribed in the JAR Libraries section\nof this guide.\nDeveloping a JAR library is much more difficult than\ndeveloping a Logisim library, but the components can be much fancier,\nincluding things like attributes and interaction with the user.\nThe built-in libraries (other than Base) were written using the same\nAPI as JAR libraries can use, so they aptly demonstrate the range of\nfunctionality that the JAR libraries can support.\nSome JAR libraries are distributed without any information about\nwhich Java class to start with. When loading such a JAR, Logisim\nwill prompt you to type a class name. This class name should be provided\nby whoever distributed the JAR file to you.\nTo remove a library, choose Unload Library... from the Project\nmenu. Logisim will prevent you from unloading libraries that contain\ncomponents used in a circuit, that appear in the toolbar, or that\nare mapped to a mouse button.\nIncidentally, a library technically contains tools, not\ncomponents. Thus, in the Base library you'll find the Poke Tool\n(), the Edit Tool\n(), and other tools that don't\ncorrespond directly to individual components.\nMost libraries, though, contain only tools for adding individual\ncomponents; all built-in libraries other than the Base library\nare like this."

This time, they will be narrow.\n(If you chose to reduce the number of inputs to 3, the AND gate\nwould not have vertical extension on the left side. But you'd also\nhave to rewire the circuit so that the wires hit the AND gate's left\nside.)\nWith some tools, the tool's icon reflects some of the attributes'\nvalues. One example of this is the Pin tool, whose icon\nfaces the same way as its Facing attribute says.\nThe tools in the toolbar each have a separate attribute set from\nthe corresponding tools in the explorer pane. Thus, even though we\nchanged the toolbar's AND tool to create narrow AND gates, the AND\ntool in the Gates library will still create wide AND gates unless\nyou change its attributes too.\nIn fact, the input pin and output pin tools in the default\ntoolbar are both instances of the Wiring library's Pin tool, but\nthe attribute sets are different. The icon for the Pin tool\nis drawn as a circle or a square depending on the value of its\n\"Output?\" attribute.\nLogisim provides a handy shortcut for changing the Facing attribute\nthat controls the direction in which many components face: Typing an\narrow key while that tool is selected automatically changes the\ndirection of the component."

Of course, we would first create\na new circuit, which we'll call \"4:1 MUX.\" To add 2-to-1 multiplexers\ninto our circuit, we click the 2:1 MUX circuit once in the\nexplorer pane to select it as a tool, and then we can add copies of\nit, represented as boxes, by clicking within the canvas.\nIf you were to double-click the 2:1 MUX circuit in the explorer pane,\nthen the window would switch to editing the 2:1 MUX circuit instead.\nAfter building up the circuit, we end up with the following.\nOur circuit for a 4-to-1 multiplexer uses three copies of the\n2-to-1 multiplexer, each drawn as a box with pins along the side.\nThe pins on this box correspond to the input and output pins in the\n2:1 MUX circuit.\nThe two pins on the west side of the box correspond\nto the two pins that face east in the 2:1 MUX circuit; the pin on\nthe box's east side corresponds to the 2:1 MUX's west-facing pin\n(which happens to be an output pin); and the pin on the box's south\nside corresponds to the 2:1 MUX's north-facing pin.\nThe order of\nthe two pins on the box's west side correspond to the same top-down\nordering from the subcircuit's design.\n(If there were several pins\non the box's north or south side, they would correspond to the same\nleft-right order in the subcircuit.)\nIf the pins in the subcircuit's layout have labels associated with\nthem, then Logisim will display that label in a tip\n(that is, a temporary text box) when the user hovers the mouse over the\ncorresponding location of the subcircuit component. (If you find these\ntips irritating, you can disable them via the\nPreferences window's Layout\ntab.)\nSeveral other components will display these tips, too: For some of the\npins of a built-in flip-flop,\nfor example, hovering over it explains what that pin does.\nIncidentally, every pin to a circuit must be either an input or\nan output. Many manufactured chips have pins that behave as an input\nin some situations and as an output in others; you cannot construct\nsuch chips within Logisim (at least, in the current version).\nLogisim will maintain different state information for all subcircuits\nappearing in a circuit. For example, if a circuit contains a\nflip-flop, and that circuit is used as a subcircuit several\ntimes, then each subcircuit's flip-flop will have its own value\nwhen simulating the larger circuit.\nNow that we have the 4-to-1 multiplexer defined, we can now use it\nin other circuits. Logisim has no limits on how deeply circuits\ncan be nested - though it will object to nesting circuits within\nthemselves!\nNote: There's nothing wrong with editing a\ncircuit that is being used as a subcircuit; in fact, this is quite\ncommon. Be aware, though, that any changes to a circuit's pins (adding,\ndeleting, or moving them) will rearrange them also in the containing\ncircuit. Thus, if you change any pins in a circuit, you will also\nneed to edit any circuits using it as a subcircuit."

To specify this, select the selection tool\n() and click the background of the circuit's\nlayout. This will show the circuit attributes in the attribute table, including\nthe Shared Label, Shared Label Facing, and Shared Label Font attributes.\nThe value of the Shared Label attribute will be drawn in the rectangle's center;\nthe Shared Label Facing attribute customizes which direction the text is drawn,\nand of course the Shared Label Font attribute customizes the font used.\nCustomized appearance\nThe default appearance is very usable, and indeed Logisim existed for many\nyears with no other option. If, however, you prefer that the subcircuit be\ndrawn differently, you can select Edit Circuit Appearance from the\nProject menu, and Logisim's interface will switch from its regular\nlayout-editing interface to an interface for drawing the circuit's\nappearance.\n(You can also click the far-right icon ()\nin the explorer pane's upper toolbar.)\nBelow, we are editing the 2:1 multiplexer's appearance so that\nit is drawn with the usual trapezoid rather than a rectangle.\nWith the appearance for the 2:1 multiplexer drawn as above,\nthe layout for the 4:1 multiplexer would then appear as the following.\nThe appearance editor is like a traditional drawing program, but there\nare a few special symbols for indicating how the drawing works when placed\ninto a circuit's layout. These special symbols cannot be removed.\nThe green circle with a line coming out of it, which we'll call the anchor.\nThere is exactly one anchor in each subcircuit appearance.\nEach component in a circuit has a single point identifying its location;\na user sees this when creating a new component:\nThe mouse click identifies just a single location, and the component is placed\nrelative to that (usually with the primary output at the mouse's location)\nThe anchor identifies the mouse's location relative to the overall drawing\nwhen the subcircuit is created.\nThe anchor also identifies the appearance's facing, as indicated by the\ndirection the anchor's line points from its circle. When placing the subcircuit\ninto a layout, the user can change the subcircuit's facing; the anchor's facing\nindicates in which direction the appearance is oriented. In our example, the\nanchor is facing east, and each instance of the subcircuit in the 4:1 multiplexer\nis also facing east, so they are all drawn in the same orientation as the 2:1\nmultiplexer's appearance.\nThe blue circles and squares with dots in them are the subcircuit's\nports. There are exactly as many ports as there are input and output\npins in the circuit.\nPorts corresponding to inputs are drawn as squares, while ports corresponding\nto outputs are drawn as circles.\nEach port indicates how a wire connecting into the\ncircuit will correspond to an input or output pin within the layout.\nWhen you select a port, Logisim will indicate the corresponding pin\nby popping up a miniature diagram of the layout in the window's bottom right\ncorner, with the corresponding pin(s) drawn in blue.

This switches\nthe explorer pane so that it shows the hierarchy of subcircuits being simulated.\nDouble-clicking an element in this hierarchy will display what is happening\ninside that subcircuit.\nThe second way you can enter a subcircuit is to bring up its popup menu\nby right-clicking or control-clicking it, and then choosing the View option.\nAnd the third way is to first ensure the Poke Tool is selected\nand then click the subcircuit you want to enter;\na magnifying glass will appear over the subcircuit's center, and\ndouble-clicking the magnifying glass will enter\nthe subcircuit's state.\nIn any case, once you enter the subcircuit, you'll see that the pins' values\nin the subcircuit match the values being sent through them from the containing\ncircuit.\nWhile in the subcircuit, you are allowed to alter the circuit. If the\nchanges affect any of the subcircuit's outputs, they are propagated into the\ncontaining circuit. One exception: The subcircuit inputs are determined based on\nthe values coming into the circuit from the supercircuit, so it doesn't make\nsense to toggle those values. If you attempt to poke a subcircuit's input,\na dialog will pop up asking, The pin is tied to the supercircuit state.\nCreate a new circuit state? Clicking No will cancel the toggle request,\nwhile clicking Yes will create a copy of the viewed state,\ndivorced from the outer circuit, with the input pin toggled.\nOnce you have completed viewing and/or editing, you can return to the parent circuit\neither by double-clicking the parent circuit in the explorer pane, or via the Go Out\nTo State submenu of the Simulate menu."

We will have an eight-bit value coming from the\ninput pin, and we want to split that into two four-bit values. In the\nbelow circuit, we have used a splitter to accomplish this: The 8-bit input\ncomes into the splitter, which divides the\n8 bits into two 4-bit values, which are then fed into the AND gate and from\nthere to the output.\nIn this example, the splitter splits an\nincoming value into multiple outgoing values. But splitters can\nalso work the other way: It can combine multiple values into a single value. In fact,\nthey are non-directional: They can send values one way at one time\nand another way later, and they can even do both at the same\ntime, as in the below example where a value travels eastward through the two\nsplitters, then is routed back westward through them again, and then back\neastward where it finally reaches its output.\nThe key to understanding splitters is their attributes.\nIn the following, the term split end refers to one of\nthe multiple wires on one side, while the term combined\nend refers to the single wire on the other side.\nThe Facing attribute tells where the split ends\nshould be relative to the combined end.\nThe Fan Out attribute specifies how many\nsplit ends there are.\nThe Bit Width In attribute specifies the bit width of\nthe combined end.\nThe Bit x attribute says which split\nend corresponds to bit x of the combined end. If multiple\nbits correspond to the same split end, then their relative ordering\nwill be the same as in the combined end. Logisim splitters cannot\nhave a bit from the combined end correspond to multiple split ends.\nNote that any change to the Fan Out or Bit Width In\nattributes will reset all Bit x attributes so that\nthey will distribute the bits of the combined value as evenly\nas possible among the split ends."

This window can be opened in two ways.\nVia the Window menu\nSelect Combinational Analysis, and the current Combinational Analysis\nwindow will appear. If you haven't viewed the window before,\nthe opened window will represent no circuit at all.\nOnly one Combinational Analysis window exists within Logisim,\nno matter how many projects are open.\nThere is no way to have two\ndifferent analysis windows open at once.\nVia the Project menu\nFrom a window for editing circuits, you can also request that\nLogisim analyze the current circuit by selecting the Analyze Circuit\noption from the Project menu. Before Logisim opens the window, it\nwill compute Boolean expressions and a truth table corresponding to\nthe circuit and place them there for you to view.\nFor the analysis to be successful, each input must be attached to an\ninput pin, and each output must be attached to an output pin.\nLogisim will only analyze circuits with at most eight of each\ntype, and all should be single-bit pins. Otherwise, you will see\nan error message and the window will not open.\nIn constructing Boolean expressions corresponding to a circuit,\nLogisim will first attempt to construct a Boolean expressions\ncorresponding exactly to the gates in the circuit. But if the circuit\nuses some non-gate components (such as a multiplexer), or if the\ncircuit is more than 100 levels deep (unlikely), then it will pop\nup a dialog box telling you that deriving Boolean expressions was\nimpossible, and Logisim will instead derive the expressions based\non the truth table, which will be derived by quietly trying each\ncombination of inputs and reading the resulting outputs.\nAfter analyzing a circuit, there is no continuing relationship\nbetween the circuit and the Combinational Analysis window.\nThat is,\nchanges to the circuit will not be reflected in the window, nor will\nchanges to the Boolean expressions and/or truth table in the window be\nreflected in the circuit. Of course, you are always free to analyze a\ncircuit again; and, as we will see later, you can replace the circuit\nwith a circuit corresponding to what appears in the Combinational\nAnalysis window.\nLimitations\nLogisim will not attempt to detect sequential circuits: If you\ntell it to analyze a sequential circuit, it will still create a truth\ntable and corresponding Boolean expressions, although these will\nnot accurately summarize the circuit behavior.\n(In fact, detecting\nsequential circuits is provably impossible, as it would\namount to solving the Halting Problem.\nOf course, you might hope\nthat Logisim would make at least some attempt - perhaps look for\nflip-flops or cycles in the wires - but it does not.) As a result,\nthe Combinational Analysis system should not be used indiscriminately:\nOnly use it when you are indeed sure that the circuit you are analyzing\nis indeed combinational!\nLogisim will make a change to the original circuit that is perhaps\nunexpected: The Combinational Analysis system requires that each\ninput and output have a unique name that conforming to the rules for\nJava identifiers.\n(Roughly, each character must either a letter or a\ndigit, and the first character must be a letter. No spaces allowed!)\nIt attempts to use the pins' existing labels, and to use a list of\ndefaults if no label exists. If an existing label doesn't follow the\nJava-identifier rule, then Logisim will attempt to extract a valid\nname from the label if at all possible.\nIncidentally, the ordering of the inputs in the truth table will\nmatch their top-down ordering in the original circuit, with ties\nbeing broken in left-right order.

As a result, when this circuit's input changes from 0 to 1, the\nAND gate will briefly see two 1 inputs, and it will emit a 1 briefly.\nYou won't see it on the screen. But the effect is observable when we\nuse the AND gate's output as an input into the clock of a D flip-flop.\nPoking the 0 input to become 1 leads to an instantaneous 1 going\ninto the D flip-flop, and thus the flip-flop's value will toggle\nevery time the circuit input goes from 0 to 1.\nEvery component has a delay associated with it. More sophisticated\ncomponents built into Logisim tend to have larger delays, but\nthese delays are somewhat arbitrary and may not reflect reality.\nFrom a technical point of view, it is relatively easy to deal with\nthis level of sophistication in a single circuit.\nDealing with gate\ndelays well across subcircuits, though, is a bit more complex;\nLogisim does attempt to address this correctly by placing all primitive\ncomponent's propagation values into a single schedule regardless of the\nsubcircuit in which the component lies.\n(Via the Project Options window's\nSimulation tab, you can configure Logisim\nto add a random, occasional delay to a component's propagation.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense.\n(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\ndoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\nIf\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.\nBut when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto distribute corresponding source code.\n(This alternative is\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.\nFor an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.\nHowever, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.\nAny attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.\nThese actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\nTherefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.\nIf you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.\nFor example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.\nMany people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.\nIn such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n10.

Despite its name, it can either\nsplit a multi-bit value into component parts, or it can combine\ncomponent parts into a multi-bit value - or indeed it can do both at once.\nA more complete description of splitters is found in the `Splitters' section of the\nUser's Guide.\nLogisim treats splitters specially when propagating values within a\ncircuit: Whereas all other components have a computed delay for purposes\nof simulating their behavior, values propagate through splitters (as\nwell as wires) instantaneously.\nNote: The term splitter is a non-standard\nterm, which is unique to Logisim as far as I know. I am unaware of any\nstandard term for such a concept; the only term I have heard used is\nbus ripper, but this term is unnecessarily violent for my\ntastes.\nPins\nTo distinguish the several connecting points for a splitter, we refer\nto the single connecting point one side as its combined end,\nand we refer to the multiple connecting points on the other side as its\nsplit ends.\nCombined end (input/output bit width matches Bit Width In attribute)\nA value holding all of the bits traveling through the splitter.\nSplit ends (input/output, bit width computed based on Bit x attributes)\nThe number of split ends is specified in the Fan Out attribute, and\neach split end has an index that is at least 0 and less than the Fan Out\nattribute. For each split end, all bits for which Bit x\nrefers to its index travels through that split end; the order of these\nbits is the same as their order within the combined end.\nAttributes\nWhen the component is selected or being added,\nthe digits '0' through '9' alter its Fan Out attribute,\nAlt-0 through Alt-9 alter both the Fan Out and Bit Width In attributes,\nand the arrow keys alter its Facing attribute.\nFacing\nThe location of the split ends relative to the combined end.\nFan Out\nThe number of split ends.\nBit Width In\nThe bit width of the combined end.\nAppearance\nSupports different ways of depicting the splitter in the circuit.\nThe Left-handed option (the default) draws a spine going left from the\ncombined end, with a labeled line coming from the spine for each split end.\nThe Right-handed option is the same except the spine goes right (if you're\nfacing according to the Facing attribute).\nThe Centered option centers the spine so it goes in roughly equal directions\nleft and right.\nAnd the Legacy option draws diagonal lines to each split end, without labels;\nthis option is primarily for compatibility with versions\nolder than 2.7.0, when this was the only option for splitter appearance.\nBit x\nThe index of the split end to which bit x of the combined\nend corresponds. The split ends are indexed starting from 0 at the top\n(for a splitter facing east or west) or from 0 at the left/west (for a\nsplitter facing north or south). A bit can be specified to correspond to\nnone of the split ends. There is no way for a bit to correspond to\nmultiple split ends.\nSometimes you can avoid twiddling each individual Bit x attribute\nby bringing up the pop-up menu for a splitter (usually by right-clicking or\ncontrol-clicking it). The pop-up menu includes options labeled Distribute Ascending\nand Distribute Descending. The Distribute Ascending option distributes the bits\nso that each split end receives the same number of bits, starting from end 0.\n(If the number of split ends doesn't divide exactly into the number of bits,\nthen the bits are distributed as evenly as possible.)\nDistribute Descending does the same but starts from the highest-numbered end.\nPoke Tool Behavior\nNone.\nText Tool Behavior\nNone."

In drawing a pin, Logisim represents output\npins using a circle or rounded rectangle, and input pins are represented\nusing squares or rectangles. In either case, the individual bits of the\nvalue being sent or received is displayed within the component (except\nwithin printer view, when the component only says how many bits wide the\npin is).\nA pin is a convenient component for interacting with a circuit, and\nbeginning Logisim users need not use them in any other way. But a\nuser building a circuit using several subcircuits (as described in the\n`Subcircuits' section of\nthe User's Guide) will use pins also\nto specify the interface between a\ncircuit and a subcircuit. In particular, a circuit layout's pin\ncomponents define the pins that appear on the subcircuit component when\nthe layout is used within another circuit. In such a circuit, the values\nsent and received to those locations on the subcircuit component are\ntied to the pins within the subcircuit layout.\nPins\nA pin component has only one pin, which will be an input to the\ncomponent if the pin is an output pin, and it will be an output to the\ncomponent if the pin is an input pin.\nIn either case, its bit width\nmatches the Data Bits attribute, and its location is specified by the\nFacing attribute.\nAttributes\nWhen the component is selected or being added,\nAlt-0 through Alt-9 alter its Data Bits attribute,\nthe arrow keys alter its Facing attribute,\nand Alt with an arrow key alters its Label Location attribute.\nFacing\nThe side of the component where its input/output pin should be.\nOutput?\nSpecifies whether the component is an output pin or an input pin.\n(Note that if the pin component is an input pin, then the pin that acts\nas its interface within the circuit will be an output, and vice versa.)\nData Bits\nThe number of bits for the value that the pin handles.\nThree-state?\nFor an input pin, this configures whether the user can\ninstruct the pin to emit unspecified (i.e., floating) values.\nThe attribute deals with the user interface only; it does not have\nany effect on how the pin behaves when the circuit layout is used as a\nsubcircuit.\nFor an output pin, the attribute has no effect.\nPull Behavior\nFor an input pin, the attribute specifies how floating values should\nbe treated when received as an input, perhaps from a circuit using the\nlayout as a subcircuit. With \"unchanged,\" the floating values are sent\ninto the layout as floating values; with \"pull up,\" they are converted\ninto 1 values before being sent into the circuit layout; and with \"pull\ndown,\" they are converted into 0 values before being sent into the\ncircuit layout.\nLabel\nThe text within the label associated with the component.\nLabel Location\nThe location of the label relative to the component.\nLabel Font\nThe font with which to render the label.\nPoke Tool Behavior\nClicking an output pin has no effect, although the pin's attributes\nwill be displayed.\nClicking an input pin will toggle the bit that is clicked. If it is a\nthree-state pin, then the corresponding bit will rotate between the\nthree states.\nIf, however, the user is viewing the state of a subcircuit\nas described in the `Debugging\nSubcircuits' of the User's Guide,\nthen the pin's value is pinned to whatever value the subcircuit is\nreceiving from the containing circuit. The user cannot change the value\nwithout breaking this link between the subcircuit's state and the\ncontaining circuit's state, and Logisim will prompt the user to verify\nthat breaking this link is actually desired.\nText Tool Behavior\nAllows the label associated with the component to be edited."

The behavior is summarized by the\nfollowing tables.\nP-type\ngate\n01X/Z\n0\n0ZX\nsource1\n1ZX\nZ\nZZZ\nX\nXZX\nN-type\ngate\n01X/Z\n0\nZ0X\nsource1\nZ1X\nZ\nZZZ\nX\nZXX\nOr in summarized form:\nP-type\ngatedrain\n0source\n1Z\nX/ZX*\nN-type\ngatedrain\n0Z\n1source\nX/ZX*\n* If source is Z, drain is Z; otherwise drain is X.\nIf the Data Bits attribute is more than 1, the gate input is still\na single bit, but its value is applied simultaneously to each of the\nsource input's bits.\nAn N-type transistor behaves very similarly to a\nControlled Buffer.

In addition,\nthe left-arrow and right-arrow keys move the cursor within the buffer, and the\ndelete key deletes the character to the right of the cursor (if any).\nThe component is asynchronous in the sense that when the buffer is empty and\nthe user types a character, that character is sent immediately as an output,\nwithout any wait for a clock pulse.\nPins\nWest edge, marked by a triangle (input, bit width 1)\nClock - when triggered while the read-enable pin isn't 0, the leftmost\ncharacter from the buffer is deleted,\nand the outputs are updated to reflect the buffer's new status.\nSouth edge, leftmost pin (input, bit width 1)\nRead Enable - when 1 (or floating or error), a clock edge will consume\nthe leftmost character from the buffer.

Additionally, the user may\ntype the left-arrow and right-arrow keys to change the location of the cursor\nwithin the buffer, and the user may type the delete key to delete the buffer\ncharacter (if any) just to the right of the cursor.\nText Tool Behavior\nNone."

    "text": "Edit Tool\nEdit Tool\nLibrary:\nBase\nIntroduced:\n2.3.0\nBehavior\nThe Edit tool allows the user to rearrange existing components and to add\nwires. Exactly what the tool does depends on where the user presses the mouse\non the canvas.\nWhen the mouse is over a wiring point for an existing component,\nor if it is atop a current wire, the Edit Tool will display a small green circle\naround the mouse's location. Pressing the button there initiates the addition of\na new wire. But if the user doesn't drag the mouse far enough to initiate a\nwire before releasing the button, the press is treated as a mouse click, and so\nthe wire is simply added into the current selection.\nThe bit width of an added wire is inferred from the components to which it\nis connected. If it is not attached to any components, the wire will be drawn\ngray to indicate that its bit width is unknown; if the components at the\nlocations that the wire helps to connect disagree on the bit width, then the\nwire will be drawn orange to indicate the conflict, and the wire will in fact\nrefuse to carry any values at all until the user resolves the conflict.\nAll wires in Logisim are either horizontal or vertical, never diagonal.\nWires are non-directional; that is, they carry values from\neither endpoint to the other. Indeed, a wire can carry values\nin both directions simultaneously: In the below example, a bit flows from the\nupper input at left through the center wire, then it circles back through the\ncenter wire, and then it circles forward again through the center wire before\nreaching the output at lower right.\nA single drag of the mouse can create multiple wire segments. The\nprecise process is a little confusing in its description; but it works\nquite intuitively in practice: If you request a particular wire segment\nusing the Wiring Tool, that segment will be split apart wherever it hits\na pin for an existing component, or wherever it hits the endpoint of an\nexisting wire segment. Also, if an endpoint of any of the new wire\nsegments hit somewhere in the middle of an existing wire, then that wire\nwill be split into multiple segments itself.\nYou can also shorten or delete an existing wire segment by initiating a drag\nat the terminus of the segment and then drawing backwards across the segment.\nDuring the drag, the shortening is indicated by drawing a white line over of the\nportion of the wire that will be removed.\nSome components draw short stubs to which wires can connect, such as the\nOR gate and controlled buffer. Logisim will\nsilently correct attempts to create wires that slightly overshoot the\nstub's end.\nIf, however, the user presses the Alt key at a point in the middle of\nthe wire, then the green circle will disappear. A mouse press selects the wire,\nand a mouse drag moves it.\nPressing the mouse button while it is within a currently selected\ncomponent begins a drag moving all elements of the selection.\nBy default, Logisim will compute a way to add new wires\nso that no existing connections are lost during the move.\n(Sometimes it will delete or shorten existing wires.)\nIf you're performing a move where you do not want these changes to be made,\nyou can press the shift key during the move.\nIf you want to disable this behavior entirely,\ngo to Project > Options, select the Canvas tab,\nand uncheck the Keep Connections When Moving box;\nin this case, the connections are computed only when the shift key is down.\nDragging a selection can lead to unexpected behavior from wires: If\nyou drag a selection including some wires on top of some other wires,\nall wires are merged, and the merged wires are placed into the\nselection.\nAs a result, if you drag the selection a second time, the\nwires previously at the location will not be left behind. This behavior\nis necessary to keep with the intuitive behavior of wires in Logisim, where\nwires never overlap. And\nit does not normally constitute a major problem: Logisim will draw the\nfull selection in the midst of dropping, and you should not drop it\nuntil you are sure it is in the correct location.\nPressing the mouse within an unselected component (but not at one of\nthe component's wiring points) drops all components from the current selection\nand selects instead the component(s) containing the clicked location.\nShift-clicking the mouse within a component toggles that component's\npresence within the selection. If multiple components include the same\nlocation, all components' presence will be toggled.\nDragging the mouse starting at a location not contained within any\ncomponents drops all components from the current selection and\ninitiates a rectangular selection.\nAll component(s) contained by the rectangle will be placed into the\nselection.\nShift-dragging the mouse starting at a location not contained\nwithin any components initiates a rectangular selection.\nThe presence in the selection of all component(s) contained by the\nrectangle will be toggled.\nHowever, if the Alt key is pressed at a location not contained within\nany components, this initiates the addition of a new wire. A small green circle\nis drawn in such a circumstance to indicate this.\nAfter selecting the desired items in the selection, you can of course\ncut/copy/paste/delete/duplicate all the items via the\nEdit menu.\nSome keys have an effect with the Edit Tool.\nThe arrow keys change the Facing attribute for all components in the\nselection that have such an attribute.\nThe Delete and Backspace keys will delete everything in the selection\nfrom the circuit.\nThe Insert and MenuKey-D keys will create a duplicate of the currently\nselected components.\nLogisim's behavior when duplicating a selection or pasting the clipboard into\na circuit is somewhat peculiar: It will not immediately place the components into the\ncircuit; instead, the selection will be a collection of \"ghosts,\" which\nwill be dropped into the circuit as soon as they are either dragged to\nanother location or removed from the selection. (This peculiar behavior\nis necessary because pasting will otherwise merge the wires of the\nselection into the current circuit at once, and the wires there\npreviously will be dragged with the pasted clipboard if the user wants\nto move the pasted components somewhere else.)\nAttributes\nNone.

This value can be edited in the\nattribute table or, using the text tool, on the canvas.\nFont\nThe font to use when drawing the label.\nHorizontal Alignment\nThe horizontal positioning technique for the text relative to the label's official location\n(where the mouse was clicked in creating the label).\n\"Left\"\nmeans that the text should be drawn so that its left edge\nis at the location; \"right\" means that the text should be\ndrawn so that its right edge is at the location; and \"center\" means that\nthe text should be drawn so that its center (horizontally) is at the\nlocation.\nVertical Alignment\nThe vertical positioning technique for the text relative to the\nlabel's official location (where the mouse was clicked in creating the\nlabel). \"Base\" means that the baseline should intersect the location;\n\"Top\" means that the text's top should intersect the location; \"Bottom\"\nmeans that the text's bottom should intersect the location; and \"Center\"\nmeans that the text should be centered (vertically) at the location.\nThe text's top and bottom is computed based on the font's\nstandard ascent and descent values; thus, even if the actual text\ncontains no tall letters (such as b) or descending letters\n(such as g), it is assumed to contain such letters for the\npurposes of vertical positioning.\nPoke Tool Behavior\nNone.\nText Tool Behavior\nAllows the text appearing within the label to be edited."
