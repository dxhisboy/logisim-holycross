Logisim Turing-Tape Component Library
-------------------------------------

This provides a "paper tape" component that can be used to build a retro-style
turing machine. The paper tape component implements the read/write head, paper
tape, and left/right motion motors. By using a finite state machine to control
the actions of the read/write head and the motion motors, one can build and
simulate the machines as described in Turing's original 1936 paper, as well as
all sorts of other automata.
