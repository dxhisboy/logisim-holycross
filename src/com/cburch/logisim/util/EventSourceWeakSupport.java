// EventSourceWeakSupport implements support for a list of references to event
// listeners. Each listener may have an owner object. So long as the owner
// object has not been garbage-collected, a strong reference is held to the
// listener preventing the listener from being garbage collected. Once the owner
// object has been garbage collected, however, or if the listener has a null
// owner, then only a weak reference will be held to the listener, meaning it
// can be garbage-collected and lazily removed from the list at any point (i.e.
// once there are no other references to the listener elsewhere).
//
// Note: The entire concept of using weak references to listeners is probably
// not worth the trouble, because the client code becomes very brittle and
// contains lots of spooky action at a distance. When listeners are weak
// references, all these seemingly-equivalent ways of adding a listener become
// subtly different:
// (1) addListener(this); // where this implements some listener interface
// (2) addListener(this.mylistener); // where mylistener is a member variable
// (3) addListener(mylistener); // where mylistener is a member variable
// (4) addListener(mylistener); // where mylistener is a method-local variable
// (5) addListener(new MyListener());
// (6) addListener(e -> this.foo());
// (7) addListener(this::foo);
// From a cursory pass through the entire code base...
// Case (1) is pretty common, and is usually fine, but it means the handler
//   code is usually separated pretty far from the call site, and it results in
//   lots of public methods which can make it harder to reason about a class.
//   And if the "this" reference is actually an inner class that accidentally
//   doesn't have any strong references, then it instead likely completely
//   broken.
// Case (2) doesn't appear at all, though it is equivalent to (3).
// Case (3) happens all the time, and is usually fine unless there are are some
//   nested inner classes happening without strong references. Unfortunately,
//   the way it is written is inditinguishable from (4), one of the buggy cases.
//   And having a member variable that is created, used once, then never used
//   again, all but invites someone to refactor it into a method-local variable,
//   like case (4), or just an immediate object, like case (5), both of which
//   are buggy cases.
// Case (4) happens rarely, but is usually a bug when it does.
// Case (5) happens sometimes, and seems to usually be a bug, except in several
//   cases where the listener list actually happens to be an ArrayList instead
//   of a weak-reference list in some particular circumstances or for certain
//   specific implementation of some service interface.
// Case (6) happens lots in newer code, and is always a bug, except when that
//   particular service uses an ArrayList instead of a weak-reference list. This
//   is also the most readable code in my opinion, however.
// Case (7) doesn't appear anywhere yet. I find this style ugly. But it would be
//   equivalent to (6), assuming Java objects do not contain internal strong
//   references to all of their member method objects. But if they do, then this
//   code is fine.
// So to summarize, the most readable and "modern" code is a bug, and the
// correct cases are fragile and hard to verify. All of this to save from having
// to remove the listeners manually, which would require thinking about the
// lifetime of client objects (and if we are wrong or miss a case, we probably
// get a memory leak). Except we clearly still need to think about the lifetime
// of client objects (and if we are wrong or miss a case, we end up with
// listeners not getting called and subtle bugs).
