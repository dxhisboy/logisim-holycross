// A list of all Clock timing/shape parameters used in a design, based on a
// complete enumeration of all Clock components in all nested subcircuits. Each
// shape is assigned a globally unique ID. For each ID, we also store a complete
// trace of Path:Net:bit points associated with that ID.
//
// In logisim, users commonly seem to place Clocks willy-nilly, relying on the
// logisim simulator to tick them all simultaneously (or if they have different
// timing/shape parameters, to globally align all the tick in an ideal but
// simplistic way). In an FPGA, we can't should not expect multiple clock
// signals to be perfectly aligned, even if they were generated using the same
// timing/shape parameters. An FPGA might also have limited clock net resources.
// So we want to reduce the number of clock distribution nets in the FPGA
// design. This is done by separating the "tick generator" functionality of a
// Clock from the Clock component, lifting all these tick generators up out of
// their circuits into the TopLevelHDLGenerator. The tick generators are
// de-duplicated according to their timing/shape parameters, assigned globally
// unique IDs, and all of their outputs formed into a single combined "hidden
// clock bus" that is then re-distributed to all circuits and subcircuits. The
// portion of the Clock components left behind in the circuits then just serve
// to select the correct bit out of the hidden clock bus to feed into their
// output port. But note than typicaly, components with a "clock port" that are
// fed by that clock signal won't typically use the raw signal from that Clock
// output port. Instead, they would take the corresponding rising/falling
// enables and the base clock signal directly from the hidden clock bus. The
// only time the raw Clock output port signal gets used is when it is fed into
// combinational logic or some port that isn't expecting a clock signal.
